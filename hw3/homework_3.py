# **********  Exercise 5.2 **********

# Define "Mutable" and list what data structures have this characteristic
print"""
Mutable objects are objects in which one can change the values.
They can be changed in place.
Mutable objects include sets, dictionaries, lists, and byte arrays.
"""

#Examples
name = ["Joel"]
name.append("Shooster")
print name

# Define "Immutable" and list what data structures have this characteristic
print"""
Immutable objects cannot be changed. Cannot be changed in place.
Examples include strings, tuples, bytes, booleans, frozen sets, integers, floats, long.
"""

#Examples
me = ("Joel")
print "Me = ('Joel')"
print "Me is a tuple. I can't say me[1] = ' Shooster'"
print "However, I can say me = me + ' Shooster'"
me += " Shooster"
print "That would return:", me #Expect Joel
